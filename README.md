# Gas_Classification_100GB

## Gas Classification with Sensor Data

### Project Overview

This project focuses on Gas Classification for 11 target gases using ~100 GB of data collected from sensor modules. The objective is to accurately predict the target gas from a set of 11 possibilities.

### About the Dataset

The dataset (~100GB) contains ~18000 time-series recordings from sensor modules (each including 8 sensors) placed in 6 horizontal and 9 vertical locations in a wind tunnel facility, in response to 10 chemical gaseous substances (one of the gases has two different concentrations).
